# # Python not in the Notebook

# %% [markdown]
# We will often want to save our Python classes, for use in multiple Notebooks.
# We can do this by writing text files with a .py extension, and then `importing` them.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Writing Python in Text Files

# %% [markdown]
# You can use a text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). If you create your own Python files ending in `.py`, then you can import them with `import` just like external libraries.

# %% [markdown]
# You can also maintain your library code in a Notebook, and use `%%writefile` to create your library, though this is not encouraged!

# %% [markdown]
# Libraries are usually structured with multiple files, one for each class.

# %% [markdown]
# We will be turning the code we have written for the maze into a library, so that other code can reuse it.

# %% [markdown]
# We group our modules into packages, by putting them together into a folder. You can do this with explorer, or using a shell, or even with Python:

# %%
import os
if 'mazetool' not in os.listdir(os.getcwd()):
    os.mkdir('mazetool')

# %%
# %%writefile mazetool/maze.py

# %% [markdown]
# In order to tell Python that our "mazetool" folder is a Python package, 
# we have to make a special file called `__init__.py`. If you import things in there, they are imported as part of the package:

# %%
# %%writefile mazetool/__init__.py
from .maze import Maze #Â Python 3 relative import

# %% [markdown]
# In this case we are making it easier to import `Maze` as we are making it available one level above.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Loading Our Package

# %% [markdown]
# We just wrote the files, there is no "Maze" class in this notebook yet:

# %%
myhouse = Maze('My New House')

# %% [markdown]
# But now, we can import Maze, (and the other files will get imported via the chained Import statements, starting from the `__init__.py` file.

# %%
import mazetool

# %% [markdown]
# Let's see how we can access the files we created:

# %%
mazetool.exit.Exit

# %%
from mazetool import Maze

# %%
house = Maze('My New House')
living = house.add_room('livingroom', 2)

# %% [markdown]
# Note the files we have created are on the disk in the folder we made:

# %%
import os

# %%
os.listdir(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'mazetool') )


# %% [markdown]
# You may get also `.pyc` files. Those are "Compiled" temporary python files that the system generates to speed things up. They'll be regenerated
# on the fly when your `.py` files change. They may appear inside the `__pycache__` directory.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The Python Path

# %% [markdown]
# We want to `import` these from notebooks elsewhere on our computer:
# it would be a bad idea to keep all our Python work in one folder.

# %% [markdown]
# The best way to do this is to learn how to make our code
# into a proper module that we can install. We'll see more on that in a [few lectures' time](./03Packaging.html) ([notebook](./03Packaging.ipynb)).

# %% [markdown]
# Alternatively, we can add a folder to the "`PYTHONPATH`", where python searches for modules:

# %%
import sys
print('\n'.join(sys.path[-3:]))

# %%
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.append(os.path.join(Path.home(), 'devel', 'libraries', 'python'))

# %%
print(sys.path[-1])

# %% [markdown]
# I've thus added a folder to the list of places searched. If you want to do this permanently, you should set the `PYTHONPATH` Environment Variable,
# which you can learn about in a shell course, or can read about online for your operating system.
