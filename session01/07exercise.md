## Week 1 Exercise

### Exercises

- Each week during the course, there will be an assessed homework exercise.
- This will be a pass/fail exercise, submitted through Git.

This week the exercise will not be assessed, since we're still getting the tools up and running.

### Installation of Python and IPython Notebook

Please concentrate on making sure that you have:

- completed the installation instructions
- can run a python file on your computer through the command line
- can load an IPython notebook.

### Installation of Git

Please make sure you can run Git at the command line:

``` bash
git --version
mkdir git_test
cd git_test
git init
<edit a file called "test.txt">
git add .
git commit -m "Example commit"
cd ..
rm -rf git_test
```

### Sign up on GitHub

Go to [GitHub](http://github.com) and create yourself an account, if you haven't already.

### Look at some IPython Notebooks

Download yourself some IPython notebooks from [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org). Load them up, and have a play.
