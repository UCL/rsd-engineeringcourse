title: Research Software Engineering with Python
layout: default

## Introduction

In this course, you will move beyond programming, to learn how to construct reliable, readable,
efficient research software in a collaborative environment. The emphasis is on practical techniques,
tips, and technologies to effectively build and maintain complex code.
This is a intensive, practical course.

## Pre-requisites

* You need to have taken a formal course in at least one programming language, including variables, control flow, and functions. This could be a semester-long course, or a shorter workshop like Software Carpentry.
* You are required to bring your own laptop.
We have also provided [setup](session99) instructions for you to install the software needed for the course on
your computer.
* Eligibility: This course is for UCL post-graduate students.

## Registration

Members of doctoral training schools, or Masters courses who offer this module as part of their programme should register through their course organisers.

### Exercises

Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in Python.
Python will be introduced during this course, but we will assume you can already
program. That means that you may find supplementary python content useful.
