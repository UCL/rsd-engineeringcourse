#
# ## Object-Oriented Design
#
# In this session, we will finally discuss the thing most people think of when they refer to "Software Engineering": the deliberate *design* of software.
# We will discuss processes and methodologies for planned development of large-scale software projects: *Software Architecture*.
#
# The software engineering community has, in large part, focused on an object-oriented approach to the design and development of large scale software systems.
# The basic concepts of object orientation are necessary to follow much of the software engineering conversation.
#
#
# ### Design processes
#
#
# In addition to object-oriented architecture, software engineers have focused on the development of processes for robust, reliable software development. 
# These codified ways of working hope to enable organisations to repeatably and reliably complete complex software projects in a way that minimises both development 
# and maintainance costs, and meets user requirements.
#
#
# ### Design and research
#
#
# Software engineering theory has largely been developed in the context of commercial software companies.
#
# The extent to which the practices and processes developed for commercial software are applicable in a research context is itself an active area of research.
#

# ## Recap of Object-Orientation

# %% [markdown]
# ### Classes: User defined types

# %%
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    def grow_up(self):
        self.age += 1

terry = Person("Terry", 76)
terry.home = "Colwyn Bay"


# %% [markdown]
# Notice, that in Python, you can add properties to an object once it's been defined. Just because you can doesn't mean you should!
#

# %% [markdown]
# ### Declaring a class 

# %% [markdown]
#
# Class: A user-defined type
#
#
#

# %%
class MyClass:
    pass


# %% [markdown]
# ### Object instances

# %% [markdown]
#
# Instance: A particular object *instantiated* from a class.
#
#
#

# %%
my_object = MyClass()


# %% [markdown]
# ### Method

# %% [markdown]
#
# Method: A function which is "built in" to a class
#
#
#

# %%
class MyClass:
    def someMethod(self, argument):
        pass

my_object = MyClass()
my_object.someMethod(value)


# %% [markdown]
# ### Constructor

# %% [markdown]
#
# Constructor: A special method called when instantiating a new object
#
#
#

# %%
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, argument):
        pass

my_object = MyClass(value)


# %% [markdown]
# ### Member Variable

# %% [markdown]
#
# Member variable: a value stored inside an instance of a class.
#
#
#

# %%
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.member = "Value"

my_object = MyClass()
assert(my_object.member == "Value")

# ## Object refactorings

# %% [markdown]
# ### Replace add-hoc structure with user defined classes

# %% [markdown]
#
# Smell: A data structure made of nested arrays and dictionaries becomes unwieldy.
#
# Before:
#
#
#

# %%
from random import random
birds = [{"position": random(),
          "velocity": random(),
          "type": kind} for kind in bird_types]

average_position = average([bird["position"] for bird in birds])


# %% [markdown]
#
#
#
# After:
#
#
#

# %%
class Bird:
    def __init__(self, kind):
        from random import random
        self.type = type
        self.position = random()
        self.velocity = random()

birds = [Bird(kind) for kind in bird_types]
average_position = average([bird.position for bird in birds])


# %% [markdown]
# ### Replace function with a method

# %% [markdown]
#
# Smell: A function is always called with the same kind of thing
#
# Before:
#
#
#

# %%
def can_see(source, target):
    return (source.facing - target.facing) < source.viewport

if can_see(hawk, starling):
    hawk.hunt()


# %% [markdown]
#
#
#
# After:
#
#
#

# %%
class Bird:
    def can_see(self, target):
        return (self.facing - target.facing) < self.viewport

if hawk.can_see(starling):
    hawk.hunt()


# %% [markdown]
# ### Replace method arguments with class members

# %% [markdown]
#
# Smell: A variable is nearly always used in arguments to 
# a class.
#
#
#

# %%
class Person:
    def __init__(self, genes):
        self.genes = genes
    def reproduce_probability(self, age): pass
    def death_probability(self, age): pass
    def emigrate_probability(self, age): pass


# %% [markdown]
#
#
#
# After:
#
#
#

# %%
class Person:
    def __init__(self, genes, age):
        self.age = age
        self.genes = genes
    def reproduce_probability(self): pass
    def death_probability(self): pass
    def emigrate_probability(self): pass


# %% [markdown]
# ### Replace global variable with class and member

# %% [markdown]
#
# Smell: A global variable is referenced by a few functions
#
#
#

# %%
name = "Terry Jones"
birthday = [1, 2, 1942]
today = [22, 11]

if today == birthday[0:2]:
    print(f"Happy Birthday, {name}")
else:
    print("No birthday for you today.")


# %% [markdown]
#
#
#
#
#

# %%
class Person:
    def __init__(self, birthday, name):
        self.birth_day = birthday[0]
        self.birth_month = birthday[1]
        self.birth_year = birthday[2]
        self.name = name
    def check_birthday(self, today_day, today_month):
        if not self.birth_day == today_day:
            return False
        if not self.birth_month == today_month:
            return False
        return True
    def greet_appropriately(self, today):
        if self.check_birthday(*today):
            print(f"Happy Birthday, {self.name}")
        else:
            print("No birthday for you.")

john = Person([5, 5, 1943], "Michael Palin")
john.greet_appropriately(today)
