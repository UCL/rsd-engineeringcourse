# ## Class Complexity
#
#
# We've seen that using object orientation can produce quite complex class structures, with classes owning each other, instantiating each other,
# and inheriting from each other.
#
# There are lots of different ways to design things, and decisions to make.
#
# > - How much flexibility should I allow in this class's inner workings?
# > - Should I split this related functionality into multiple classes or keep it in one?
# > - To reuse functionality: should I use inheritance, or add class variable which it is delegated to?

# %% [markdown]
# ### Inheritance vs composition
#
# The last point is known as `is-a` vs `has-a` or inheritance vs composition.
#
# Both options allow us to define a way for classes to collaborate while also having a single responsibility.
# As a rule of thumb, we suggest choosing composition over inheritance unless you have a strong reason.
# As we go into below, composition introduces fewer dependencies and assumptions about how your code will be used in the future.
#
# **Inheritance** *(is-a)*:
#
# - Used if you want to have the same functionality across multiple instances
# - Abstracting commonly used methods or data, so all children can use the generic functionality
#     - This has a drawback because we make large assumptions about how the code will be used in the future,
#       which is often hard or impossible to do the first time
# - If we find a bug in the functionality, this can be fixed in one place
#     - This is good because one change can be cascaded
#     - This can be bad because every subclass relies on its parent and changing one may need us to change the other
#       (known as tight coupling)
#
#
# **Composition** *(has-a)*:
#
# - Create separate classes (component) which carry out the shared functionality.
# - Instead of inheriting a method, instantiate the class with the components as class variables,
#   when that functionality is required then we call that method on from the component.
# - Unlike inheritance, you can design each component's interface independently
#   so that it knows how to interact with other parts of your code
# - Potential to have some code duplication
#     - Doesn't have the problem of side effects cascading when you alter one component.

# ## Design Patterns

# %% [markdown]
#
# Programmers have noticed that there are certain ways of arranging classes that work better than others.
#
# These are called "design patterns".
#
# They were first collected on one of the [world's first Wikis](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors), 
# as the [Portland Pattern Repository](http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?PatternIndex).
#

# %% [markdown]
# ## Reading a pattern

# %% [markdown]
#
# A description of a pattern in a book such as the [Gang Of Four](https://www.worldcat.org/title/design-patterns-elements-of-reusable-object-oriented-software/oclc/31171684)
# book ([UCL Library](https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=UCL_LMS_DS21146030410004761&context=L&vid=UCL_VU2&search_scope=CSCOP_UCL&tab=local&lang=en_US)) usually includes:
#
# * **Intent** - what's the purpose
# * **Motivation** - why you want to use it
# * **Applicability** - when do you want to use it
# * **Structure** - what does it look like (e.g., UML diagram)
# * **Participants** - What are the different classes in it
# * **Collaborations** - how they work together
# * **Consequences** - What are the results and trade-offs
# * **Implementation** - How is it implemented
# * **Sample Code** - In practice.
#

# %% [markdown]
# ## Introducing Some Patterns

# %% [markdown]
#
# There are lots and lots of design patterns, and it's a great literature to get into to
# read about design questions in programming and learn from other people's experience.
#
# We'll just show a few in this session:
#
# * [Strategy](#Strategy-Pattern)
# * [Factory Method](#Factory-Method)
# * [Builder](#Builder-Pattern)
#
# Some explanations won't click for some people even though we've tried.
# So if you're stuck on wrapping your head around a pattern,
# check out another explanation from the [other resources section](#Other-resources)

# ## Strategy Pattern

# %% [markdown]
#
# Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one
# (e.g. use composition, or a `has-a` relationship instead of inheritance), and make them interchangeable.
# Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently, without requiring any class that uses it to change.
#

#
# - We want to analyse the variation in sunspot activity
# - Sunspot activity is cyclical, we expect to find this cycle to be about 11 years
# - We can use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to process the sunspot signal
#

# %% [markdown]
# ## Years are not constant length

# %% [markdown]
# After we've started out analysis we realise there's a potential problem with this analysis:
#
# * Years are not constant length
# * Leap years exist
# * But, the Fast Fourier Transform assumes evenly spaced intervals
#
# We could:
#
# * Ignore this problem, and assume the effect is small;
# * Interpolate and resample to even times;
# * Use a method which is robust to unevenly sampled series, such as [LSSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-squares_spectral_analysis);
#
# We also want to find the period of the strongest periodic signal in the data, there are
# various different methods we could use for this also, such as integrating the fourier series
# by quadrature to find the mean frequency, or choosing the largest single value.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Number of child-classes can increase quickly

# %% [markdown]
# We could implement a base class for our common code between the different approaches,
# and define derived classes for each different algorithmic approach. However, this has drawbacks:
#
# * The constructors for each derived class will need arguments for all the numerical method's control parameters,
# such as the degree of spline for the interpolation method, the order of quadrature for integrators, and so on.
# * Where we have multiple algorithmic choices to make (interpolator, periodogram, peak finder...) the number
# of derived classes would explode: `class SunspotAnalyzerSplineFFTTrapeziumNearMode` is a bit unwieldy.
# * The algorithmic choices are not then available for other projects (so we may have to reinvent the wheel next time)
# * This design doesn't fit with a clean Ontology of "kinds of things": there's no Abstract Base for spectrogram generators...

# %% [markdown]
# ###Â Apply the strategy pattern:

# %% [markdown]
# * We implement each algorithm for generating a spectrum as its own Strategy class.
# * They all implement a common interface
# * Arguments to strategy constructor specify parameters of algorithms, such as spline degree
# * One strategy instance for each algorithm is passed to the constructor for the overall analysis

# * A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates

# With polymorphism we can use any image object returned form the `read_image` function without
# knowing the underlying image source.
#
# Having this in a class can allow for more complex logic to determine which child
# class should be returned from the factory method, including leveraging the statefullness of the
# class to help with the logic.

# ## Builder Pattern

# %% [markdown]
# **Intent**: Separate the steps for constructing a complex object from its final representation.

# ## Builder example

# %% [markdown]
# Imagine that we have a large model with many parameters that we want to run.
#
# There's a lot more to defining a model than just adding agents of different kinds:
# we need to define boundary conditions, specify wind speed or light conditions.
#
# We could define all of this for an imagined advanced Model with a
# very very long constructor, with lots of optional arguments:

# %% pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
class Model:
    def __init__(self, xsize, ysize,
                 agent_count, wind_speed,
                 agent_sight_range, eagle_start_location):
        pass


# %% [markdown]
# ### Builder preferred to complex constructor

# %% [markdown]
# However, long constructors easily become very complicated.
# Instead, it can be cleaner to define a Builder for models.
# A builder is like a deferred factory:
# each step of the construction process is implemented as an individual method call,
# and the completed object is returned when the model is ready.
#

# %% pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
# Create a bare bones Model so that we can use our builder

class Model:
    def __init__(self,):
        ...

    def simulate(self):
        print("Starting simulation")
        ...



# %% pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
class ModelBuilder:
    def start_model(self):
        self.model = Model()
        self.model.xlim = None
        self.model.ylim = None
        
    def set_bounds(self, xlim, ylim):
        self.model.xlim = xlim
        self.model.ylim = ylim
    
    def add_agent(self, xpos, ypos):
        pass # Implementation here
    
    def finish(self):
        self.validate()
        return self.model
    
    def validate(self):
        assert(self.model.xlim is not None)
        # Check that the all the
        # parameters that need to be set
        # have indeed been set.


# %% [markdown]
#
# Inheritance of an Abstract Builder for multiple concrete builders could be used
# where there might be multiple ways to build models with the same set of calls to the builder:
# for example a version of the model builder yielding models which can be executed
# in parallel on a remote cluster.
#

# %% [markdown]
# ## Using a builder

# %% pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
builder = ModelBuilder()
builder.start_model()

builder.set_bounds(500, 500)
builder.add_agent(40, 40)
builder.add_agent(400, 100)

model = builder.finish()
model.simulate()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Avoid staged construction without a builder.

# %% [markdown]
#
# We could, of course, just add all the building methods to the model itself,
# rather than having the model be yielded from a separate builder.
#
# This is an antipattern that is often seen: a class whose `__init__` constructor alone is insufficient
# for it to be ready to use. A series of methods must be called, in the right order,
# in order for it to be ready to use.
#
# This results in very fragile code: its hard to keep track of whether an object instance is "ready" or not.
# Use the builder pattern to keep deferred construction in control.

# %% [markdown]
# We might ask why we couldn't just use a validator in all of the methods that must follow the deferred constructors;
# to check they have been called.
# But we'd need to put these in *every* method of the class,
# whereas with a builder, we can validate only in the `finish` method.
