    "#### Inheritance vs composition\n",
    "\n",
    "The last point is known as `is-a` vs `has-a` or inheritance vs composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both options allow us to define a way for classes to collaborate while also having a single responsibility.\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, we suggest choosing composition over inheritance unless you have a strong reason.\n",
    "As we go into below, composition introduces fewer dependencies and assumptions about how your code will be used in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** *(is-a)*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used if you want to have the same functionality across multiple instances\n",
    "- Abstracting commonly used methods or data, so all children can use the generic functionality\n",
    "    - This has a drawback because we make large assumptions about how the code will be used in the future,\n",
    "      which is often hard or impossible to do the first time\n",
    "- If we find a bug in the functionality, this can be fixed in one place\n",
    "    - This is good because one change can be cascaded\n",
    "    - This can be bad because every subclass relies on its parent and changing one may need us to change the other\n",
    "      (known as tight coupling)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composition** *(has-a)*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create separate classes (component) which carry out the shared functionality.\n",
    "- Instead of inheriting a method, instantiate the class with the components as class variables,\n",
    "  when that functionality is required then we call that method on from the component.\n",
    "- Unlike inheritance, you can design each component's interface independently\n",
    "  so that it knows how to interact with other parts of your code\n",
    "- Potential to have some code duplication\n",
    "    - Doesn't have the problem of side effects cascading when you alter one component.\n",
